          <h2 className="mb-2">About me</h2>
          <p>With over 10 years of experience in building websites and web applications, I specialise in delivering polished, high-performance solutions using core web technologies like <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, as well as working with the <strong>MERN stack</strong> - <strong>Mongo DB</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>Node JS</strong> and <strong>React</strong>. I have been involved at every stage of the <strong>Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</strong>, communicating effectively with both technical and non-technical team members.</p>
          <p>I pride myself on attention to detail, ensuring that every element contributes to a seamless user experience. If you&apos;re looking for a developer with a strong technical background, a passion for continuous growth, and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions, please feel free to get in touch.</p>
          <p>When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m a proud dad to a 5-year-old daughter (who keeps me on my toes ðŸ˜†). I enjoy spending time with my family and reading. I believe balancing work and life gives me fresh perspectives, which I bring into my problem-solving and creativity at work.</p>

          <h2 className="mb-2">Learning and Teaching</h2>
          <p>My drive to continuously learn keeps me updated on the latest industry trends and best practices, enabling me to build creative and efficient projects. I also share my knowledge and teach others on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DevDreamer" target="_blank" className="bg-red-50 text-[#dd0031] font-semibold">YouTube channel - Dev Dreamer</a>, where I make Web Development easy to understand and follow.</p>
          <p>In addition to hands-on development, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with others. Through my YouTube channel, Dev Dreamer, I strive to make complex web development concepts accessible and easy to understand for aspiring developers. By creating tutorials, coding challenges, and in-depth explanations, I aim to empower individuals to confidently embark on their own web development journeys. This teaching experience not only helps others to grow but also keeps me engaged with the community, receiving valuable feedback and insights that further enhance my skills and understanding of the field.</p>
